Notes:
Added Lye to ice water cooled 40C. Mixed all oils except cocoa butter and melted at 50C. Removed the oils from heat and cooled to 40C. Added lye to the melted fats at 40C final temp. Stirred with whisk at  for couple minutes. Mixed with stick blender for a couple minutes to a light trace. Added the cocoa butter, milk, and honey and stirred by hand until the cocoa butler chips melted (minutes). Stirred another minute with the stick blender to a moderate trace. Poured into molds (2L ice-cream box and 2x 1L ice cream containers). The 2L container got quite warm as it was setting, but the 1L containers stayed cool.

The soap set in the molds for 72 hours and then was cut. The corner was still a bit soft and broke when removing from the ice cream tub. They were ages for 5 weeks before use.
